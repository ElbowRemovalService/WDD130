    <h1>What is Philosophy?</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Philsophy often gets a bad wrap in common circles. Many people tend to dismiss philosophy as useless, or as irrelevant quibbling about what really is. It is often equated with groups like hippies, constantly high, never serious, and never practical. This is an unfair and shortsided perspective to hold on the topic. Philosophy is not merely two old men in a room thinking about metaphysics (although that certainly counts). Rather, <b>philosophy is the pursuit of knowledge</b>. This pursuit extends into every part of reality. </p>
